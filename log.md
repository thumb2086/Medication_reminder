### Log: 2025/10/23 - Build Fix

**Objective:** Resolve the critical build error `Unresolved reference: fragment` and clean up remaining warnings.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Diagnosed Root Cause:** The `Unresolved reference: fragment` error was traced back to a missing definition in the Gradle version catalog (`libs.versions.toml`). The `app/build.gradle.kts` file was trying to use `libs.androidx.fragment.ktx`, but this alias was not defined.

2.  **Fixed Version Catalog (`libs.versions.toml`):**
    -   Added `fragmentKtx = "1.8.9"` to the `[versions]` section.
    -   Added `androidx-fragment-ktx = { group = "androidx.fragment", name = "fragment-ktx", version.ref = "fragmentKtx" }` to the `[libraries]` section.

3.  **Verified `app/build.gradle.kts`:**
    -   Ensured the dependency was correctly using the version catalog alias: `implementation(libs.androidx.fragment.ktx)`.

4.  **Gradle Sync:** Performed a Gradle sync, which completed successfully, confirming the dependency issue was resolved.

5.  **Cleaned Up `MainViewModel.kt`:**
    -   Fixed a non-nullable value error by ensuring `medicationList.value` is handled correctly before being updated.
    -   Refactored `SharedPreferences` calls to use the modern KTX `edit { ... }` extension function.
    -   Removed the unused `saveAllData` function.

6.  **Cleaned Up `HistoryFragment.kt`:**
    -   Removed an unused `date` variable.

7.  **Cleaned Up `ReminderSettingsFragment.kt`:**
    -   Removed all redundant `as?` type casts.

8.  **Restored `build.gradle.kts` to use Version Catalog:**
    -   Reverted the hardcoded dependencies for `fragment-ktx` and `mpandroidchart` back to their version catalog aliases (`libs.androidx.fragment.ktx` and `libs.mpandroidchart`).

**Result:**

The project now builds successfully. All critical errors have been resolved, and major warnings have been addressed. The project is in a stable, modern, and maintainable state.

### Log: 2025/10/24 - Form Validation Improvement

**Objective:** Fix the medication reminder form's validation issue where it would show a generic 'not filled out' error, even when all fields appeared complete.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Diagnosed Root Cause:** The validation was failing because the user hadn't added any reminder times. The UI wasn't clear that the 'Select Time' field was a button that needed to be clicked to add times.

2.  **Improved UI (`medication_input_item.xml`):**
    -   Changed the 'Select Time' button's text to 'Add Time' to make its purpose more intuitive.

3.  **Added String Resources (`strings.xml`):**
    -   Added a new string, `add_time`, for the updated button text.
    -   Added a new, more specific validation string, `please_add_time`, to guide the user.
    -   Removed the now-unused `select_time` string.

4.  **Improved Validation Logic (`ReminderSettingsFragment.kt`):**
    -   Updated the validation logic to check specifically if any reminder times have been added. If not, it now shows the `please_add_time` message, making it clear to the user what needs to be done.

**Result:**

The medication reminder form is now more intuitive and provides clearer feedback to the user, preventing confusion and ensuring all necessary information is provided.

### Log: 2025/10/25 - Restore Settings and Add Medication List

**Objective:** Restore the settings icon and functionality, and add a new page to display a list of all medication reminders.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Restored Settings:**
    -   Added a settings icon to the main screen's toolbar.
    -   Created a new `SettingsFragment` to host the app's settings.
    -   Implemented a theme setting, allowing the user to choose between light, dark, and system default themes.

2.  **Added Medication List Page:**
    -   Added a new "Medication List" tab to the main screen.
    -   Created a `MedicationListFragment` to display a list of all configured medication reminders.
    -   Implemented a `MedicationListAdapter` to efficiently display the medication list.

**Result:**

The settings functionality has been restored, and a new medication list page has been added, improving the app's usability and providing a more comprehensive overview of the user's medication schedule.

### Log: 2025/10/26 - Fixed Resource Linking Error

**Objective:** Resolve the Android resource linking build error.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Diagnosed Root Cause:** The build was failing due to an `Android resource linking failed` error. The root cause was a missing dependency on the `androidx.preference:preference-ktx` library.

2.  **Added Dependency:** Added `implementation("androidx.preference:preference-ktx:1.2.1")` to the `dependencies` block in `app/build.gradle.kts`.

3.  **Corrected Namespace:** While investigating, it was also noted that the attributes in `preferences.xml` were incorrectly using the `android:` namespace instead of the `app:` namespace required by the AndroidX Preference library. This was corrected by adding `xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"` and changing the prefixes of all attributes to `app:`.

**Result:**

The resource linking error has been resolved, and the project now builds successfully.

### Log: 2025/10/27 - Code Cleanup

**Objective:** Address all remaining warnings in the project.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **`strings.xml`:**
    *   Renamed the `not_set` string to `status_not_set` to avoid a conflict with a private resource in the `androidx.preference` library.

2.  **`ReminderSettingsFragment.kt`:**
    *   Removed the unused import `android.widget.AutoCompleteTextView`.
    *   Removed the unused `i` parameter in the `mapIndexed` function when creating `timesMap`.

3.  **XML Layouts:**
    *   Removed the unused `xmlns:android` namespace declaration from `res/xml/preferences.xml`.
    *   Removed the unused `xmlns:app` namespace declaration from `res/layout/medication_input_item.xml`.

**Result:**

All warnings have been resolved, and the project is now clean and maintainable.
