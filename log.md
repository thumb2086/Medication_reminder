### Log: 2025/10/23 - Build Fix

**Objective:** Resolve the critical build error `Unresolved reference: fragment` and clean up remaining warnings.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Diagnosed Root Cause:** The `Unresolved reference: fragment` error was traced back to a missing definition in the Gradle version catalog (`libs.versions.toml`). The `app/build.gradle.kts` file was trying to use `libs.androidx.fragment.ktx`, but this alias was not defined.

2.  **Fixed Version Catalog (`libs.versions.toml`):**
    -   Added `fragmentKtx = "1.8.9"` to the `[versions]` section.
    -   Added `androidx-fragment-ktx = { group = "androidx.fragment", name = "fragment-ktx", version.ref = "fragmentKtx" }` to the `[libraries]` section.

3.  **Verified `app/build.gradle.kts`:**
    -   Ensured the dependency was correctly using the version catalog alias: `implementation(libs.androidx.fragment.ktx)`.

4.  **Gradle Sync:** Performed a Gradle sync, which completed successfully, confirming the dependency issue was resolved.

5.  **Cleaned Up `MainViewModel.kt`:**
    -   Fixed a non-nullable value error by ensuring `medicationList.value` is handled correctly before being updated.
    -   Refactored `SharedPreferences` calls to use the modern KTX `edit { ... }` extension function.
    -   Removed the unused `saveAllData` function.

6.  **Cleaned Up `HistoryFragment.kt`:**
    -   Removed an unused `date` variable.

7.  **Cleaned Up `ReminderSettingsFragment.kt`:**
    -   Removed all redundant `as?` type casts.

8.  **Restored `build.gradle.kts` to use Version Catalog:**
    -   Reverted the hardcoded dependencies for `fragment-ktx` and `mpandroidchart` back to their version catalog aliases (`libs.androidx.fragment.ktx` and `libs.mpandroidchart`).

**Result:**

The project now builds successfully. All critical errors have been resolved, and major warnings have been addressed. The project is in a stable, modern, and maintainable state.
