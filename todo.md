### TODO

1.  **Build Verification:**
    *   Run a clean build and ensure the app runs on a device or emulator to confirm the fix.

2.  **Gradle Sync:**
    *   Perform a Gradle sync to ensure the new dependency is correctly integrated.

3.  **Testing:**
    *   Thoroughly test the settings page to ensure all preference items function as expected.

4.  **Code Review:**
    *   Review the `app/build.gradle.kts` file to ensure the new dependency has been added correctly and doesn't introduce any conflicts.
